## Section 508 compliance for the visually-impaired:

Visually-impaired web users face unique challenges when using screen reader devices and applications to navigate the Internet. 

For those reliant on screen readers, the reality is that the Internet is full of pitfalls that lead to difficulty and frustration. 

**These issues include but are not limited to:** Confusing navigation menus, low-contrast design colors, the use of images in place of text without alt-text to provide the screen reader with captions or descriptions, and more.

In response, the U.S. Federal government has devised a set of standards to ensure that visually-impaired users and other disabled individuals will face the least amount of challenges possible when navigating the web: The Section 508 Laws. 

Background information on Section 508 can be found at [Section508.gov](https://www.section508.gov/section508-laws), and the site also contains [a list outlining all of the standards](https://www.section508.gov/summary-section508-standards).

To ensure that a site is Section 508 compliant, there browser extensions available that can automatically detect errors in the hopes of validating full 508 compliance.

## 508 Compliance Tools:

**WAVE:** The [Web Accessibility Validation Tool (WAVE)](http://wave.webaim.org/) can be used directly through the site. However, as a best practice to validate internal or offline content, it is recommended to use one of the WAVE browser extensions for Chrome or Firefox.

**Total Validator:** [Total Validator](http://wave.webaim.org/) is another powerful and effective 508 compliance tool that is available in desktop versions for Windows, OS X and Linux, or as a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox. The pro edition can validate sites that are password protected or accessible behind forms, validate more than one site at a time, and more.

One major component of 508 compliance is ensuring that alt text (the text that appears when your mouse hovers over an image) describes each image without redundancy.

Here’s an example of best practices for image titles and image alt-text [[source]](http://www2.le.ac.uk/webcentre/plone/build/basics/add-images/alt-text):

Remember to keep your alt-text **accurate, equivalent and succinct.**

Bear in mind that using a screen reader can require long stretches of time to listen to the content of entire pages, so there are instances in which alt text can be inappropriate or tedious. 

For example, purely decorative images that have nothing to do with the site’s content do not require alt text. It wastes time for a screen reader to finish saying “Arrow, arrow, blue circle, blue circle” to describe meaningless page decorations before moving on to actual content.

Lastly, redundant images do not need alt text. For example, if an image or diagram is provided to reinforce understanding of the page’s content but does not provide any additional or fresh information, reading it aloud may prove *image of a text bubble captioned with the word “redundant”* redundant.
