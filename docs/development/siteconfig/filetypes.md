# Adding or Removing Allowed Resource File Types

Any type of file can be uploaded to Resources. Though only CSV files can be imported to the Datastore.

File types are controlled at "/admin/structure/types/manage/resource/fields/field_upload"

To add or remove file types navigate as an 'administrator' and enter extensions into the "Allowed file extensions" field.
