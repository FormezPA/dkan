Major Components
----------------------

**DKAN** is an open data portal built in [Drupal](http://drupal.org). DKAN is designed to be feature-compatible with [CKAN](http://ckan.org), the Open Data portal built by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org).

### DKAN Features

With DKAN, you can:

* Easily publish datasets in key machine readable formats including JSON, XML, RDF and more
* Share datasets through an API
* Manage the importing of large datasets

The following pages provide further information about DKAN features:

* [Data Catalog Features](/dkan-documentation/dkan-features/catalog-features)
* [Dataset Features](/dkan-documentation/dkan-features/dataset-features)
* [Data Preview Features](/dkan-documentation/dkan-features/data-preview-features)
* [Datastore Features](/dkan-documentation/dkan-features/datastore-features)
* [DKAN Workflow](/dkan-workflow) 

Optional add-on modules to extend DKAN's functionality are listed in the [Extending DKAN section](/dkan-documentation/extending-dkan).

Since DKAN is built in [Drupal](http://drupal.org), it can serve as both a cutting edge data portal as well as an enterprise content management system (CMS). Moreover, DKAN can easily be extended with many of the 30,000+ Drupal modules.
